•	The high performing schools and low performing schools remained the same there was a slight change in the percentages of the Thomas high school overall passing grades.
•	Spending remained the same for all the schools with Hernandez high school having the greatest spending per student.
Summary:
Removing the ninth-grade score from the THS data made a slight difference in the analysis but not enough to change the order of things.
Cabrera and Thomas remained the top performing schools and Hernandez spent the most per student. The top performing school types are Charter schools and the worst performing schools are District schools.
